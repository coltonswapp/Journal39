This is a simple journal application using Firebase as the backend service. Create, read, &amp; update journal entries quickly &amp; easily. 

## PLEASE BE SURE TO READ THESE NEXT 2 INSTRUCTIONS.

> In order to setup a Firebase project, you MUST register that app at firebase.google.com. Part of that setup process is entering in YOUR app bundle (can be found in Signing and Capabilites), and dowloading a configuration file. Basically, this app will never 100% work, because you will not have access to the database that I created. But the principles are there. 

* The recording from this zoom, where I show how to download CocoaPods, install the pods required for Firebase to work, can be found here. `https://strategiced.zoom.us/recording/detail?meeting_id=rLIXbHsCT4GtI1OKAHcGQw%3D%3D`

> If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. 

* Also included in this project is a fun little textfield manipulation where we add some subLayers to the frame to spice it up a little. That code can be found in the `EntryDetailController`.

### Sidenote - another great resource for learning Firebase is the `HypeFire` project that was created by Cameron Stuart. The link to that repo is: `https://github.com/DevMountain/HypeFire`
